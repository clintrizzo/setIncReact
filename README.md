## Description:
Strategic Electrical Technolgies is an Orange County based Electrical Contractor. Our mission is to provide quality and efficiency in every task performed. From the simple Lighting Maintenance, to the more complex Energy Management Systems and Variable Frequency Drives. The quality is apparent in the finished product.

My brother in law is owner of setinc and has given permission for me to create a practice website based off his current live site. The main resource for this project is from [setinc](http://setincusa.net/). The reason for this build is to practice react on the side and continue to build more knowledge on the framework. The main intention is to establish a single page website that is interactive for a user as well as being mobile friendly. 

This readme will be a work in progress and will be continously updated based off the libraries being used.
